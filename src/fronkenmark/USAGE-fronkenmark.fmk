[code [stet verbatim text stet] code] The [code stet code] tag prevents [i any i] processing of the enclosed text from occurring. No Fronkenmark formatting. No smart quotes. No linking. The text will appear exactly as it is written. This is occasionally useful.

[h2 Links h2]

[code [link Secondary Page link] code] Link to the internal page with the title "Secondary Page".

[code [link https://some.external.site.com link] code] Link to the external site with the URL https://some.external.site.com.

[code [link Secondary Page|Cool Page link] code] Link to the internal page with the title "Secondary Page", but display the alternate text "Cool Page" rather than "Secondary Page".

[code [link https://some.external.site.com|Cool Site link] code] Link to the external site with URL https://some.external.site.com, but display the text "Cool Site" rather than the URL.

[code [menulink Settings link] code] Opens the internal menu with the title "Settings". The difference between this and a wiki link is that opening a menu does not navigate away from the current page. When the menu is closed, the original page reappears. Menus are kept in the menus/ folder.

[code [doclink Formatting doclink] code] Opens the internal documentation page with the title "Formatting" (in other words, the exact document you're looking at right now). As with menulink, doclink does not navigate away from the current page. When the doc is closed, the original page reappears. Docs are kept in the docs/ folder.

[code [!schemelink scheme procedure(s)|caption schemelink!] code] creates a link with the given caption that executes the supplied Scheme procedure when the link is clicked. More than one Scheme expression is permitted. The expressions are wrapped in a lambda, with an evt parameter corresponding to the click event (this is so you can identify the source of the click, if needed).

Example:

[code [!schemelink (display-wiki-page "Main")|Home schemelink!] code] produces:

[!schemelink (display-wiki-page "Main")|Home schemelink!]

[code [anchorlink anchorid|anchor link text anchorlink] code] creates a link to the HTML anchor element (see below) on the same page with the given id. If anchor link text is provided, it is displayed as the link text. Otherwise the anchorid is used.

[code [anchor anchorid|anchor text anchor] code] creates an HTML anchor element (see below) on the same page with the given id. If anchor text is provided, it is displayed as the anchor text. Otherwise the anchorid is used.

Example:
[code [anchorlink foobar|link to the foobar anchor anchorlink] code] creates a link to an anchor:

[anchorlink foobar|link to the foobar anchor anchorlink]

and:

[code [anchor foobar|this is the foobar anchor anchor] code] creates the anchor to which the link navigates.

[anchor foobar|this is the foobar anchor anchor]




[h2 Paragraph formatting h2]

[code [p text p] code] Format text as a normal paragraph (you can also simply separate paragraphs with blank lines, as you would in Markdown).

[p Call me Ishmael. Some years ago --- never mind how long precisely --- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off -- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  p]

[code [pc text pc] code] Format text as a centered paragraph.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  pc]

[code [pl text pl] code] Format text as a left-aligned paragraph (this is the default, but you may occasionally need to use this if some other code has changed the alignment).

[code [poetry text poetry] code] Poetry is typeset with spacing and line breaks intact. Typographic quotes and dashes are used, and the poetry block is centered based on the longest line.

This piece is the famous Mouse's tail/tale from [i Alice in Wonderland i] which is formatted to resemble a mouse's tail. Font sizing (see below) is also used to make the "tail" text get smaller toward the tip.

[code [pcursive paragraph pcursive] code] Set an entire paragraph in a cursive typeface. See [code [cursive] code] above for doing this in the middle of a block of text.

[pcursive Call me Ishmael. Some years ago --- never mind how long precisely --- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. pcursive]


[code [pfantasy paragraph pfantasy] code] Set an entire paragraph in a fantasy typeface. See [code [fantasy] code] above for doing this in the middle of a block of text.

[pfantasy Call me Ishmael.

[altcode [code text code] altcode]

You may format text as source code either inline [code x = 3; code] or as a code block:
[altcode
[code

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

code]
altcode]

produces:

[code

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

code]
Optionally, you may specify a language for a code block to ensure proper syntax highlighting The default is [code scheme code], as seen in the previous example. The example below uses [code javascript code]):
[altcode

[code javascript

function hello(){
	alert("Hello, world!");
}

code]
altcode]

produces:

[code javascript

function hello(){
	alert("Hello, world!");
}

code]

Even more occasionally, you may need to use verbatim [altcode [code code] altcode] tags in a document -- that is, you may want the code tag to be visible, rather than performing its normal function (many of the examples in this document needed to do that). You can accomplish this by wrapping the content in &lsqb;altcode altcode&rsqb; tags.

[h2 Lists h2]
[code
[ul
First item
Second item
Third item
ul]
code]

This formats the items as an unordered (bulleted) list, like this:
[ul
First item
Second item
Third item
ul]

[code
[ol
First item
Second item
Third item
ol]
code]

This formats the items as ordered (numbered) list, like this:
[ol
First item
Second item
Third item
ol]

[code
[menu
Main
Kitchen Sink
IncludeTest
menu]
code]

Produces a menu for selecting wiki pages. The text should be a list of wiki page titles, one per line. The menu items will be auto-linked to their respective page, like this:
[menu
Main
Kitchen Sink
IncludeTest
menu]

[code
[!schememenu
(alert "You clicked the first one!") (alert "And here's another expression!")|First choice
Second choice(alert "You clicked the second one!")|Second choice
(alert "You clicked the third one!")|Third choice
schememenu!]
code]

This produces a menu where Scheme expressions are evaluated when the items are clicked. As with the regular menu, the text contains one entry per line, but the menu text is followed by a | character, then the Scheme expression(s) to evaluate. The result of the above code is this:

[!schememenu
(alert "You clicked the first one!")  (alert "And here's another expression!")|First choice
(alert "You clicked the second one!")|Second choice
(alert "You clicked the third one!")|Third choice
schememenu!]

The Scheme expression(s) are automatically wrapped in a lambda to make it easier to evaluate multiple expressions:
[code

  (lambda (evt)
    expression 1
    expression 2
       .
       .
       .
    expression n)
code]

The [code evt code] parameter is the JavaScript click event on the menu item, so if need be you can locate the source of the event, etc.


[code
[roundlist
First item
Second item
Third item
roundlist]
code]

Like menu, but does [b not b] auto-link the items. Each item has the class [code .round-list-item code], so you can add your own custom handler if desired. The above code produces this:

[roundlist
First item
Second item
Third item
roundlist]

[h2 Typographic markup h2]

[code [hr] code] Insert a horizontal rule, as below.

[hr]

[code [br] code] Insert a line break.

[code [nbsp] code] Insert a non-breaking (hard) space.

[code [scenebreak text scenebreak] code] Insert a scene break, with the specified text centered on a line by itself (usually the text will be something like asterisks, or a decorative character like [hedera], etc.) Examples:
[scenebreak * * * scenebreak]
[scenebreak [hedera][hedera][hedera] scenebreak]

[code [pagebreak] code] Insert a forced page break at this point. Has no visible effect on a normal web screen, primarily useful for printing or in  formatting ebooks.

[code [dropcap Call me Ishmael. dropcap] code] Formats the first character of the text as a drop cap. Any additional characters in the text will be formatted as small caps.

[dropcap Call me Ishmael. dropcap] Some years ago --- never mind how long precisely --- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

Fronkenmark attempts to convert "" and '' to their "smart" (curly) counterparts (support for proper quotes in non-English languages is forthcoming). Unfortunately, proper quoting in English (at least) is not easily reducible to a simple algorithm. It's not hard to [i almost i] get it right, but there are tough corner cases. If need be, you can cheat by manually inserting [code &amp;lsquo; code] for &lsquo;, [code &amp;rsquo; code] for &rsquo;, [code &amp;ldquo; code] for &ldquo;, and  [code &amp;rdquo; code] for &rdquo;.

Fronkenmark also makes the following substitutions:

[code -- code] Insert an "en" (short) dash, --


[code --- code] Insert an "em" (long) dash, ---


[code ... code] Insert an ellipsis, ...


If you don't want "smart quoting" to happen, you can use:
[code [nosmart] code] which disables smart quotes for the page it's in.

[h3 Special characters h3]
[code [asterism] code] -> [asterism],
[code [club] code] -> [club],
[code [c] code] -> [c],
[code [dagger] code] -> [dagger],
[code [degree] code] -> [degree],
[code [diamond] code] -> [diamond],
[code [doubledagger] code] -> [doubledagger],
[code [frown] code] -> [frown],
[code [heart] code] -> [heart],
[code [hedera] code] -> [hedera],
[code [lozenge] code] -> [lozenge],
[code [manicule] code] -> [manicule],
[code [numero] code] -> [numero],
[code [orda] code] -> [orda],
[code [ordo] code] -> [ordo],
[code [p] code] -> [p],
[code [peace] code] -> [peace],
[code [pilcrow] code] -> [pilcrow],
[code [refmark] code] -> [refmark],
[code [r] code] -> [r],
[code [sectionsign] code] -> [sectionsign],
[code [sm] code] -> [sm],
[code [smile] code] -> [smile],
[code [spade] code] -> [spade],
[code [tm] code] -> [tm]

The appearance of these may vary considerably, depending on the system you're using and what fonts are installed.

[h3 Font sizing h3]

Fronkenmark supports [latex LaTeX latex]-style font sizing:

[code [tiny text tiny] code] produces [tiny text tiny].

[code [scriptsize text scriptsize] code] produces [scriptsize text scriptsize].

[code [footnotesize text footnotesize] code] produces [footnotesize text footnotesize].

[code [small text small] code] produces [small text small].

[code [normalsize text normalsize] code] produces [normalsize text normalsize].

[code [large text large] code] produces [large text large].

[code [Large text Large] code] produces [Large text Large].

[code [LARGE text LARGE] code] produces [LARGE text LARGE].

[code [huge text huge] code] produces [huge text huge].

[code [Huge text Huge] code] produces [Huge text Huge].

[code [HUGE text HUGE] code] produces [HUGE text HUGE].

[h3 Unicode characters h3]

You can enter arbitrary Unicode characters in the form [code U+hhhh code], where hhhh corresponds to the hexadecimal digits of the desired character.  Of course, it's impossible to include every available Unicode symbol, but the included KitchenSink font package has good coverage for many ancient and modern languages, and most modern browsers have good coverage of emoji.

For example:

[code U+1F600 code] produces U+1F600.

[code U+1F480 code] produces U+1F480.


[h3 Icons h3]

[code [icon smile icon] code] inserts the icon with the given name.


[icon smile icon]

Note that this is different from the [smile] special character (though they may look similar depending on which font your machine is using). Icons are [i images i] rather than [i characters i].

See [doclink List of Icons doclink] for a list of available icons.


[h2 Multimedia Tags h2]

[h3 Images h3]

Both remote images and images in the internal Fronkensteen file system are supported. Images can be imported into the file system from the Media submenu of the Main menu.

[code [img fronkensteenlogo.png img] code] inserts the specified (local) image at this position

[code [img https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/42942914 img] code] inserts the specified (web) image at this position.

[code [img fronkensteenlogo.png #fronkensteen-logo!title='Fronkensteen Logo'!width='100'!height='100' img] code] inserts the image, using the specified [doclink Programming|SEML doclink] markup.

[h3 HTML5 audio and video h3]

The HTML5 audio and video tags support the use of multiple formats. Just add additional files in the tag, separating each one with a comma. Both remotely loaded and internal files are supported. Media files can be imported into the file system from the Media submenu of the main menu. Internal audio and video files should be used sparingly, as they tend to bloat the Fronkensteen file size and slow down page loading. If practical, link to audio and video files on the Web.

[code [audio https://url-to-audio-file.mp3 audio] code] HTML5 audio, using an audio file on the web.

[code [audio media/audio-file.mp3 audio] code] HTML5 audio, using an internal internal audio file resource.

[code [video https://url-to-video-file.mp4 video] code] HTML5 video, using a video file from the web..

[code [video media/video-file.mp4 video] code] HTML5 video, using an internal video file.

[code [youtube URL youtube] code] Produces an embedded YouTube video of the default size using the given YouTube URL

[code [youtube URL width height youtube] code] Produces an embedded YouTube video of the given width and height from the given YouTube URL

[h2 Tables h2]
[code [table table data table] code] Renders the given data in tabular format.

[code html
[table

4,5,6
7,8,9
table]
code]

Produces:
[table
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
table]

You may provide an optional template, which consists of one format line per line of data. It specifies whether to format the corresponding table element as a header "h", left-aligned "l", right-aligned "r" or centered "c". The default is "r" (right-aligned). If there are more data lines than template line, the last template line is used for all subsequent data lines.

[code
[table

ccc
rrr
lll
Column 1, Column 2, Column 3
1,2,3
